I am a student currently in my Second Year of Software engineering. 
I have a strong passion for Programming, Finance and the intersection between the two. 

In my spare time , I apply the theory of what is taught in my classess to create projects that benifit the community and that are helpful to people. 
I also follow macroeconomics and the stockmarket very closely because it is something that I'm very passionate about.
